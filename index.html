<h1>Blog Calendar</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<body>My idea is for a website that allows users to log in and see their own calendar. On the calendar, the user can insert any information they want, 
including due dates, birthdays, events, etc. The differing feature of this application is that each day the user has the option 
to create a diary or blog post. The idea of this post is to be a summary and reflection on the day, where the user can put down their thoughts. Though not necessary, the user can submit this blog post and
refer to it whenever they wish, and the day they submitted it will have a small icon over 
it on the calendar that will allow the user to see what days they submitted the post and link them to it.</body>
