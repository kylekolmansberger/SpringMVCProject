<h1>Blog Calendar</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<body>My idea is for a website that allows users to log in and see their own calendar. On the calendar, the user can insert any information they want, 
including due dates, birthdays, events, etc. The differing feature of this application is that each day the user has the option 
to create a diary or blog post. The idea of this post is to be a summary and reflection on the day, where the user can put down their thoughts. Though not necessary, the user can submit this blog post and
refer to it whenever they wish, and the day they submitted it will have a small icon over 
it on the calendar that will allow the user to see what days they submitted the post and link them to it.</body>
<h2>Project Design</h2>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<body>SpringMVC, SQLite Database, Blog API/Technology, UI Visualization, Google Calendar API(Possibly)</body>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<body><ul><li>Create Profile</li>
  <li>Add Event Information</li>
  <li>Edit Event Information</li>
  <li>Create Blog Posts</li>
  <li>View Previous Posts</li>
  <li>Manipulate Calendar</li></ul></body>
<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
<body><ol>
  <li>Checkpoint 1- Create Login, Register, and Blog Entry forms and create welcome page for user signing in</li>
  <li>Checkpoint 2 - Begin adding Datbase to project by installing mysql and starting to figure out how to intertwine the two</li>
  <li>Checkpoint 3 - Finish adding the database to the project and begin or finish incorporating the google calendar api</li></ol>
Final Project will be fully functional and debugged by the 17th or 24th depending on the due date. The final project will include all
  use case functionality and some mild design of the UI.</body>
<h2>Project Justification</h2>
<body>I find this project intersting because it serves two seperate purposes that can be tied together but typically aren't.
  Besides simply serving as an event calendar or a blog site, by intergrating the two the user can get a feel for why they might have said
  the things they said on they days they did. For example, a user can read a previous blog post and at the same time see what events happened
  that day, what due dates might have been coming up, and so on, so that they get an understanding as to what events were surrounding that
  blog post and had influences on that post. The main point of this project is to show people how events in their life influence the way they think and feel. As far as a showcase of skill, I feel that this project will provide an adequate challenge for
  me with incorporating a calendar and database, but still be of a small enough scope that I can complete the project within the given time frame.
  As I've stated in some daily blog posts, the amount of time I have to spend on this project is limited, so I feel that this project finds a good middle
  ground between time and difficulty.</body>
