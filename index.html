<h1>Blog Calendar</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<body>My idea is for a website that allows users to log in and post blogs about their mood and why they are feeling that way. The 
idea of this post is to be a summary and reflection on the day, where the user can put down their thoughts and feelings, and how they interact. 
The user will then be able to search blogs by the day or by the mood they were feeling, allowing them to find out how they felt on a specific day or what they post like when they feel a specific way and see what days they felt that way.</body>

<h2>Project Justification</h2>
<body>I find this project justified because you don't see many blogs that are geared around emphasizing your mood to yourself. This blog makes you use
one word(hypothetically) to define your mood, and then post about why you are feeling that way and what thoughts you are having.
You are then able to look up when you were feeling a certain way and what you were feeling on certain days. This allows for the user to reflect on mood
and emotional state, as well as the thoughts that were coming to them at the time. Because this blog allows for deeper emtional reflection, it is
somewhat of a mental health tool.</body>
